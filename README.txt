# üß† AI News Digest Workflow (n8n)

This project demonstrates how an **AI-powered workflow** can automatically fetch, summarize, and deliver personalized news using the **n8n** automation framework.  
It was created as part of my exploration of different types of AI agents (workflow-based, coding, and autonomous) described in my Medium article:

## üöÄ Overview

The workflow connects several APIs and LLM functions to generate a personalized news digest twice a day.  
It was built in **n8n Community Edition (self-hosted)** and uses OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4o-mini model for summarization.

**Workflow steps:**
1. Fetch latest articles from **GNews API** for multiple topics.  
2. Merge articles into a single dataset.  
3. Use an **LLM node** to generate concise summaries.  
4. Filter out empty or irrelevant summaries.  
5. Save articles for further queries using similarity comparison in a vector database (Weaviate).  
6. Send the summarized digest to the user via email.  

The workflow is fully visual ‚Äî no custom coding required.
